Spine-ts
========
This is a contributed Spine Typescript runtimes, they are based on spine-js official runtimes except that classes were separated to make code easily readable.

the compiled output in build\spine.js is the equivalent of spine-js runtime all namespaces, method names, arguments ...etc are the same.
this mean that you can use either the spine-ts build or spine-js official release with the TypeScript definition files. 

in demo folder you'll find a spine demo using spine-ts build, it's in pure javascript with native canvas2D, so no external engine is required to run the demo.

please note that some spine features are not implemented in this demo.
